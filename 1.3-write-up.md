<h1>low prism value vulnerability</h1>

The prism value of ork1 is 100000000, which is extremely low compared to other challenges. This leads me to guess that ork2 prism value is in the hundreds of millions. This makes it possible for us to brute force the ork2 prism value.

As the diagram shows, we can know the expected output of ork2 given a password (in this case, "AAAAA"). We can try to recreate this output on our local machine by multiplying "AAAAA" with a bunch of prism values. If we can recreate it, that means we correctly guessed the prism value. 

After that, the rest is the same as challenge 1.2 and 1.3. We know the ork1 and ork2 prism values, so we can brute force the prize password locally.

The code for brute forcing prism value is here:

```
export async function test1() { 
    var config = {
        urls: ["https://ork1.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com", "https://ork2.westus2.cloudapp.azure.com"],
        encryptedData: []
    }

    const passwordPoint = await Point.fromString("AAAAA");
    const clients = config.urls.map(url => new NodeClient(url, "Prism")); // create node clients
    const appliedPoints = clients.map(client => client.Apply(passwordPoint)); // get the applied points from clients
    const promises = await Promise.all(appliedPoints)
    const ork2_expected = promises[1]
    console.log("ork2_output:")
    console.log(ork2_expected)

    for (var i = 0; i >= 300000000; i++) {
        if (i % 1000 == 0) {
            console.log(i)
        }
        const ork2PrismVal = BigInt(i)
        const ork2_brute = new Point(passwordPoint.times(ork2PrismVal).getX(), passwordPoint.times(ork2PrismVal).getY())
        if (ork2_brute.isEqual(ork2_expected)) {
            console.log(ork2PrismVal)
            alert(ork2PrismVal)
            return
        }
    }
}
```
