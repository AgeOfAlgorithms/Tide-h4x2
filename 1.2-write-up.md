<h2>Weak Prism Value</h2>

The vulnerability is in ork2.

In the following explanation, * indicates Elliptic Curve multiplication and + is EC summation. (To learn more, @Hulio  shared this resource before: https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/ecdsa). 

The equations I use are based on the information on this diagram (see Test Password section): https://github.com/tide-foundation/Tide-h4x2/blob/main/diagrams/svg/H4x2_Challenge.svg

Moreover, I removed the blurring (and deblurring) functions which should make the equations simpler, and brute forcing faster. 

passwordPoint is our attempted password converted into a point.
Ork2 is supposed to take in a passwordPoint and perform: 

`gPassPrism2 = passwordPoint * ork2PrismVal`

Ork2 outputs to us gPassPrism2, which is a new point. 
Ork1 does the same as ork2 and outputs gPassPrism1, and the two outputs are combined and hashed to produce the PRISMKey:

`PRISMKey = hash(gPassPrism1 + gPassPrism2)`

finally, PRISMKey is used to attempt to decrypt the encrypted message.
And that's how it should normally function (without blurring). 

However, in this challenge, if you debug the inputs and outputs of the orks, you will notice that while ork1 works as expected, ork2 simply outputs its input (i.e. does nothing). I played around with EC arithmetic and found that this can only happen when ork2PrismVal = 1. 
so basically,

`gPassPrism2 = passwordPoint * 1 = passwordPoint`

, and

`PRISMKey = hash(gPassPrism1 + gPassPrism2) = hash(gPassPrism1 + passwordPoint)`

We can compute gPassPrism1 since we know ork1PrismVal (it's public). We know the passwordPoint since that's what we are inputting.
So we can compute the PRISMKey locally from any desired password and attempt to decrypt the encrypted message. 

We need to brute force a 5 letter password, where a hint is "Q" (from twitter). I went with offline brute-forcing, same as in challenge 1.1 writeup (I refer to it there as method #2). So we are trying: Q????, ?Q???, ??Q??, ???Q?, ????Q. 
Roughly, ignoring double/triple/quadruple letter combo repeats, there are (26^4)*5 = 2,284,880 combinations... which is no joke (in comparison, previous iteration was (26^3)*4 = 70,304). Rough estimation suggests brute forcing would take around 100 hours in the worst case running in serial on my computer. 
I wanted to parallelize the task, so I used 3 computers and opened 4 tabs on each (so 12 processes) to brute-force different sections of the alphabet combinations. 
Here's the code for brueforcing:

```
export async function getRandom() {
  const encryptedData = ["UYROpJfRXejxAF/fZY/9fHEewpV77eB+IvoZWkW1EaAYlP0VhuVg"] // prize
  const ork1PrismVal = BigInt("3634360791371181805687651988766661851162015591970309011816617491433270805263")

  for (let i = 25; i >= 0; i--) {
    var first = String.fromCharCode(65 + i)
    for (let j = 25; j >= 0; j--) {
      var second = String.fromCharCode(65 + j)
      for (let k = 25; k >= 0; k--) {
        var third = String.fromCharCode(65 + k)
        for (let l = 25; l >= 0; l--) {
          var fourth = String.fromCharCode(65 + l)
          var brute_vals = [
            "Q" + first + second + third + fourth,
            first + "Q" + second + third + fourth,
            first + second + "Q" + third + fourth,
            first + second + third + "Q" + fourth,
            first + second + third + fourth + "Q"
          ]
          for (let m = 0; m < brute_vals.length; m++) {
            const brute_val = brute_vals[m]
            const passwordPoint = await Point.fromString(brute_val);
 
            const ork1 = new Point(passwordPoint.times(ork1PrismVal).getX(), passwordPoint.times(ork1PrismVal).getY())
            const ork2 = passwordPoint

            const authPoint = [ork1, ork2].reduce((sum, next) => sum.add(next))
            const keyToEncrypt = await SHA256_Digest(authPoint.toBase64()); // Hash the authentication point for added security
            var decrypted = null;
            var a;
            for (a = 0; a < encryptedData.length && decrypted == null; a++) {
              try {
                decrypted = await decryptData(encryptedData[a], keyToEncrypt); // Attempt to decrypt the data
              } catch {
                decrypted = null;
              }
            }

            console.log(brute_val + ": " + decrypted)
            if (decrypted != null) {
              return
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

and that got me the flag.
